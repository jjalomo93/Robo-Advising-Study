![Blooom Logo](https://www.goodfinancialcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blooom-1.png)

## Company Origin and Key Statistics

### How It Began
---
Out of Overland Park, Kansas a new robo-advising company was founded specifically to target individual 401k/retirement management. **Blooom** was founded in 2013 by co-founders Chris Costello, Kevin Conard, and Randy AufDerHeide. The inspiration for Blooom was that corporations have failed the average consumer.<sup>[1]</sup> The company believes that wealth management firms favor the extremely wealthy as opposed to the majority of Americans. Combined with the disappearance of pensions in America and social security falling short of supporting families, the American consumer has had to navigate retirement planning on their own with little guidance. Blooom has set out to use technology to provide financial advice that is easy to digest for the average American so that they can make informed decisions when planning for the future.

### Funding Their Idea
---
In the second half of 2014, Blooom won the Finovate Best in Show Award.<sup>[2]</sup> After winning the award, venture capitalists began to approach the founders with funding proposals. It was not until 2015 that the company began to seek funding from external investors. In October 2015, Blooom raised $4 million in a round of Series A funding.<sup>[3]</sup> The funding was led by QED Investors, but other companies like DST Systems Inc., Commerce Ventures, Hyde Park Venture Partners, and UMB were included as well. In the same year, another $60 thousand was raised through other avenues.<sup>[4]</sup> Lastly, in a Series B in February 2017, Blooom was able to raise $9.15 million in additional funding led by existing investors QED Investors and Commerce Ventures.<sup>[5]</sup>
