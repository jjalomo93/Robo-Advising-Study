# Robo Advising and Blooom
![Blooom Logo](https://www.goodfinancialcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blooom-1.png)

## Company Origins and Funding

### How It Began
---
Out of Overland Park, Kansas, a new robo-advising company was founded specifically to target individual 401k/retirement management. **Blooom** was founded in 2013 by co-founders Chris Costello, Kevin Conard, and Randy AufDerHeide. The inspiration for Blooom was that corporations have failed the average consumer.<sup>[[1]](#Resources)</sup> The company believes wealth management firms favor the extremely wealthy as opposed to the majority of Americans. Combined with the disappearance of pensions in America and social security falling short of supporting families, the American consumer has had to navigate retirement planning on their own with little guidance. Blooom has set out to use technology to provide financial advice that is easy to digest for the average American so they can make informed decisions when planning for the future.

### Funding Their Idea
---
In the second half of 2014, Blooom won the Finovate Best in Show Award.<sup>[[2]](#Resources)</sup> After winning the award, venture capitalists began to approach the founders with funding proposals. It was not until 2015 that the company began to seek funding from external investors. In October 2015, Blooom raised $4 million in a round of Series A funding.<sup>[[3]](#Resources)</sup> The funding was led by QED Investors, but other companies like DST Systems Inc., Commerce Ventures, Hyde Park Venture Partners, and UMB were included as well. In the same year, another $60,000 was raised through other avenues.<sup>[[4]](#Resources)</sup> Lastly, in a Series B in February 2017, Blooom was able to raise $9.15 million in additional funding led by existing investors QED Investors and Commerce Ventures.<sup>[[5]](#Resources)</sup>


## Blooom's Business Strategy

### The Current Problem
---
According to founder Chris Costello, he was originally inspired to start Blooom after taking a deeper look at how individual 401k plans were managed by Wealth Management companies. He believed that 401k plans were widely mismanaged and companies were not focused on providing quality investment guidance to small-time investors.<sup>[[6]](#Resources)</sup> This led to the idea of automating investment re-allocation for the everyday American. Blooom set its goal to assist any investor with the ability to manage their retirement online.

As of May 2017, Blooom identified that nearly 90 million Americans currently participated in contribution retirement plans such as 401k, 403b, and TSP. This represents about $4.5 trillion in investment.<sup>[[6]](#Resources)</sup> With $4 billion in assets under management, the market opportunity for Blooom is huge.<sup>[[7]](#Resources)</sup>

### Blooom's Solution
---
First and foremost, Blooom uses robo-advising to provide investment guidance to millions of everyday Americans with employer-sponsored retirement accounts. Their competitive advantage stems from the fact that they were the first company to target this niche of the financial services industry. To this day, they are still one of the only companies that operate in this space. This provides a huge benefit to Americans with employer-sponsored retirement accounts who are too often ignored by the financial institutions that serve them. While initially focusing on 401k and other types of employer-sponsored accounts, they have now added IRAs into their offerings as their assets under management have continued to increase.<sup>[[8]](#Resources)</sup>

The main technologies Blooom uses are algorithms and data aggregation APIs. Their algorithm uses the customer's age, estimated retirement date, and fund options via the retirement plan to determine the best allocation of assets for the customer. This is broken into 13 asset classes and defaults to the lowest cost option for the user.<sup>[[6]](#Resources)</sup> Blooom uses the Envestnet | Yodlee data aggregation engine as their API to pull customer data from individual retirement online accounts. This service collects data from the customer's retirement account website and feeds it into the Blooom website for analysis. From there, the algoritm determines the best portfolio mix for the customer.<sup>[[6]](#Resources)</sup>

In this video, Blooom presents the problem they encountered and the solution they have provided.

## Blooom's Space in the Industry

### Robo-Advising within FinTech
---
Blooom is one of the leading startups in the Robo-Advising domain of the Financial Services Industry. They were the first company to offer this service to employer-sponsored retirement accounts and are still one of the only companies that offer this specific service. In recent years, the robo-advising domain has shown that technology and big data can outperform traditional financial planning professionals. While fee structures at traditional wealth management companies can be quite expensive, robo-advising offers an inexpensive solution to portfolio management with a higher degree of accuracy. This has allowed the domain to make big impacts in asset allocation, balance projection, insurance management, tax management, retirement planning, and estate planning.<sup>[[9]](#Resources)</sup> While traditional financial planning relies on human judgement for investment advice, robo-advising firms are now using deep learning, quantitative finance, and big data in order to provide specialized solutions for both corporations and individuals.

### Competition within the Domain
---
Within the past few years, the robo-advising domain has become quite saturated. Most major financial institutions have entered the robo-advising arena and have the capability to box out smaller startups. Some even believe that the window of opportunity for new startups to enter the space has closed if the startup does not have the backing of a large financial institution.<sup>[[10]](#Resources)</sup>

The main competitors in the Robo Advising domain include<sup>[[11]](#Resources)</sup>:  
* Wealthfront
* Interactive Advisors
* Betterment
* Personal Capital
* M1 Finance
* Merrill Guided Investing
* E*TRADE Core Portfolios

## Blooom's Achievements

Blooom has disrupted the robo-advising and wealth management industries with their platform. They have provided the average American a simple platform that gives easy-to-digest investment advice for their retirement funds. The company is highly rated on various review websites, with high marks in Investment Options, Fee Structures, Technology, and Ease of Use.<sup>[[8]](#Resources)</sup> The company is working in a niche of financial management that is often overlooked, and that is one of their greatest sources of growth.

Within wealth management companies, one of the main core metrics by which companies measure success is total Assets Under Management (AUM). Since its inception in 2013, Blooom has gained over $4 billion in AUM. No other company has reached this AUM milestone at the same pace as Blooom. The company has even outpaced its industry-leading competitors Wealthfront and Betterment.<sup>[[12]](#Resources)</sup> While Wealthfront and Betterment both have over $20 billion in AUM, Blooom is in a position to overtake both of these companies based on its current growth and the amount of available assets in their sector of the wealth management industry.

## Recommendations

If I were to recommend anything to Blooom, it would be to expand the coverage of investment accounts that the company currently offers. While there is a tremendous market for employer-sponsored retirement accounts, many Americans also have individual investment accounts and individual retirement accounts. Providing investment guidance for all of these options has the potential to vastly increase the company's assets under management. Additionally, the large financial institutions offer a great variety of investment management products. Blooom is uniquely positioned to siphon customers from these larger institutions because they do not favor the extremely wealthy and offer a low-cost fee structure that other companies cannot offer. Another recommendation would be to provide 24/7 access to an investment professional via an online chat tool. I believe this would benefit the company because many Americans are often checking investment outside of normal business hours. Providing this access would allow them to get on-demand assistance on a timeline that fits with their schedules.

I believe that the current technologies Blooom uses are adequate to cover the additional account management offerings. Based on their strategy, they only need to pull the available investment options per account and are still able to make suggestions using their existing algorithm. For the 24/7 investment advice, the company could look into using machine learning and AI to create an advisor tool that is completely online and does not require human input. This would save the company money in overhead when it comes to headcount cost. Many companies such as Amazon and other financial institutions already use bots for customer service, so I think it would benefit Blooom to implement this as well.
